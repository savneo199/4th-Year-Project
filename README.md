Please find all the MATLAB and Arduino codes used for the purposes of the 4th year project by Team 22

"ESP32_Cadence.ino" is the Arduino code used to programme the ESP32 SoC to connect automatically with the cadence sensor and read and decrypt the raw cadence data. 
Hence, the ESP32 notices when rotational motion is induced in the system (i.e. when the user starts pedalling) and sends a 5V signal to the ESC to set the motor in motion.

"torque_bolts" is the MATLAB code used to calculate the torque and force applied on a bolt and was used to dtermine the tightening force of the bolt used for FEA simulations
