Please find all the MATLAB and Arduino codes used for the purposes of the 4th year project by Team 22

"Mesh Convergence Ansys" contains the data used for the mesh convergence study and the MATLAB code used to conduct the mesh convergence study and plot the charts.

"Bicycle Electrification Kit Survey (Responses).xlsx" contains the data and analysis from the responses of the survey conducted. 

"ESP32_Cadence.ino" is the Arduino code used to programme the ESP32 SoC to connect automatically with the cadence sensor and read and decrypt the raw cadence data. 
Hence, the ESP32 notices when rotational motion is induced in the system (i.e. when the user starts pedalling) and sends a 5V signal to the ESC to set the motor in motion.

"SEMS instructions manual.pdf" is the instruction manual of how to mount and operate the kit.

"bumps.mlx" contais the MATLAB code with the forces calcuation in the case a rider goes over a bump at certain velocity.

"modes.mlx" contains MATLAB code with the vibration analysis of the E-bike conversion kit.

"motor_forces.mlx" contains MATLAB code with the analysis of the desired motor output parpameters and the comparison with the output parameters of the selected motor (Maxfind M3 Hub Motor).

"torque_bolts" is the MATLAB code used to calculate the torque and force applied on a bolt and was used to dtermine the tightening force of the bolt used for FEA simulations.
