Please find the data for total deformation and the number elements of each component that was used in FEA simulations in the Excel File "Mesh-Convergence-Ansys.xlsx".
There is also the accompanying code used to analayse, clea and plot the data to conduct the mesh convergence study. 
The code imports the data from the excle file, cleans it and plots the mesh converge graphs. 
The graphs are also automatically saved as .png images.
